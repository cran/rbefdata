rbefdata 0.3.4
==================

* Introduces a helper "bef.extract.metadata()" which is a wrapper to the function 
  attributes() and helps to extract the metadata information of a dataset object. 
* Introduces a helper that opens the URL to a dataset in the browser given an id 
  bef.goto.dataset_page(id).
* Adds base API for tematres bef.tematres.api() to easily exploit the vocabulary. 
* Adds base API for media wiki bef.mediawiki.api() to easily get descriptions of a term 
  from a media wiki. It takes a term and the language of the Wikipedia queried can be changed
  by two character country code Wikipedia uses for its sub domains.
* Adds an upload method for datasets (bef.portal.upload.dataset()). It takes a dataset 
  object (data frame) or file path (to CSV file) for upload and a title.
* Re-factors several functions as well as some names. Defuncts the old deprecates and adds 
  new de-functioned functions. 
* Improves the metadata read from eml (ecological metadata language files) provided by 
  the BEF-Data portal for each dataset. Now also supporting information about related 
  material provided as freeformats for the dataset.

  as well as all associated datasets from a paper proposal and a range of datasets 
  in one step if you provide the ids.

* New functions `bef.searchTematres("keyword")`, `bef.searchTematresUpper("keyword")`, and
